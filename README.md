### Part 1: About the course

- Why?
  - LLMs: Custom vs Proprietary
  - [Ollama]
- What ?
  - [Course Mechanics](./material/about-course.md)
- How?
  - [Vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) e.g. using [Bing Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) vs [LLM as typing assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding#cite_note-:3-1)
  - [Group Formation](./material/teams.md) 
  - Mini Projects
- Big Picture
  - Finnish Industry & Custom LLMs
  - AI Agents, RAG etc. (Out of Scope)
- Activities:
  - [Activity 0 (Optional)](./material/activity0.md)
  - [Activity 1](./material/activity1.md)


> When it comes to defining what exactly constitutes vibe coding, [Simon Willison](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/) makes an important distinction: "If an LLM wrote every line of your code, but you've reviewed, tested, and understood it all, that's not vibe coding in my book—that's using an LLM as a typing assistant." Vibe coding, by contrast, involves accepting code without fully understanding how it works.

### Part 3: Types of ML Systems

- Machine Learning vs Deep Learning vs Generative AI
- ML systems fall into one or more of the [following categories] based on how they learn to make predictions or generate content:
  - [Supervised learning]
    - Regression
    - Classification
  - Unsupervised learning
  - Reinforcement learning

### Part 4: Tools

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
  - [Create colab](http://colab.research.google.com/#create=true)
  - Markdown: [Intro](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb), [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- [Activity 2](./material/activity2.md)
- [Activity 3 (Optional)](./material/activity3.md)

<!-- > Note: While we will be using Google Colab, you can experiment on your own machine as well, particularly if you have access to a high-performance GPU. -->
