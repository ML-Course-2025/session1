# Activity 1: What if?


In this group activity, each group will explore the potential of creating a custom Large Language Model (LLM). Here's the plan:

- Consider this question: `If you were given enough resources, what LLM would your group build?`
- What will the LLM do and why is it important?
- Think about all the different ways your LLM could be used in various jobs or industries.
- Discuss why it's exciting that your LLM can give personalized answers and solutions.

> Each group will share their ideas and findings with the rest of the class when we come back from the breakout room.
