# Title: Machine Learning Sessions

## Course Structure:  

This course "Cloud Computing Fundamentals and Machine Learning" is divided into two complementary parts: Machine Learning (60%) and Cloud Computing (40%). 

The Machine Learning (ML) sessions are scheduled for **Tuesdays** from **9:00 to 12:00** and will be conducted via Zoom. In these hands-on sessions, you will explore the fundamentals of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and advanced tools like large language models (LLMs). 

This part of the course is designed for beginners, requiring minimal programming or advanced mathematics. Think of it as "Machine Learning Simplified"—making powerful techniques accessible to everyone. By the end of the 8 weeks, you will construct a fully functional project, combining classical ML, neural networks, and cutting-edge models like BERT and LLMs to tackle real-world problems such as:
- Log classification
- Customer support ticket categorization
- Fraud detection in bank transactions
- Security threat detection

### Overview

The Machine Learning part of the course introduces foundational and advanced ML concepts in an incremental, engaging manner:
- Week 1 starts with ML foundations and brainstorming project ideas. 
- You'll progress through classical ML techniques (e.g., regression and classification), neural networks, and deep learning.
- The focus will shift to modern NLP techniques like BERT and the application of state-of-the-art LLMs.

By the final week, you will integrate all these techniques into a hybrid AI system. These systems balance rule-based approaches, ML algorithms, and human feedback to solve complex problems. 

Why focus on LLMs? Understanding and leveraging large language models is now critical for professionals—recent industry trends indicate that companies without GPT-like tools may face significant challenges in the coming years.


### Learning Outcomes

By completing this course, you will:

1. Gain **some** practical experience with foundational and introductory advanced ML techniques.
2. Build **basic** skills in applying classification and regression techniques to real-world datasets.
3. Learn to use NLP tools, **starting from a high-level perspective**, such as BERT and LLMs, for advanced problem-solving.
4. Design and implement **simple** hybrid AI systems that combine rule-based approaches, ML, and human feedback.
5. Deliver a functional AI project that addresses a real-world challenge.
