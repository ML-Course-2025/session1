# How We’re Forming Teams

To make sure teams are balanced, effective, and aligned with project goals, we’re using a simple and fair process based on your responses to the poll questions. Here’s how it works and why we’re doing it this way:

---

### **Step 1: Grouping by Project Topic Preferences**  
- To ensure every team is focused and engaged with their project, we’ll start by grouping people based on their 1 to 2 preferred topics (e.g., IT support, security, health, banking). This ensures team members share a common interest or expertise, fostering collaboration and alignment with project goals.

### **Step 2: Assigning Roles**  
- Each team needs defined roles to function effectively:  
   - **Leader**: Someone ready to guide and keep things organized.  
   - **Morale Booster**: Someone who keeps the group positive and motivated.  
   - **Problem-Solver**: A team member skilled in logical analysis and troubleshooting.  
   - **Creative Thinker**: Someone with innovative ideas and out-of-the-box thinking.  
- We’ll assign these roles across each team, ensuring that all roles are filled.

### **Step 3: Considering Working Time Compatibility**  
- Your preferred working times (e.g., daytime, late night, or adaptable schedules) will be considered. Teams will be formed to align with similar working rhythms, ensuring smoother collaboration and better time management.

### **Step 4: Balancing Work Mindset and Challenges**  
- Your responses about project mindsets and frustrations (e.g., enjoying bug fixes or disliking unresponsive teammates) will be used to match compatible work styles within teams. This helps minimize potential conflicts and promotes a productive environment.

### **Step 5: Ensuring a Diversity of Strengths**  
- To create well-rounded teams, we’ll balance technical strengths based on overall problem-solving and creative preferences. This ensures each group has a mix of complementary skills suited to their project focus.

### **Step 6: Incorporating Shared Interests**  
- Fun preferences like your dream snack (e.g., pizza or energy drinks) and time-travel destination (e.g., future tech or past legends) will be factored in to build camaraderie. While secondary to team functionality, these elements add a personal touch, making teamwork more enjoyable.

### **Step 7: Choosing the Right Team Reward**  
- Team reward preferences (e.g., hiking trips or free premium coding platform subscriptions) will influence the final adjustments, ensuring team goals feel meaningful and engaging for everyone.

- A shared interest in their chosen project topic for better collaboration.  
- Clearly defined roles to maintain organization and positivity.  
- Compatibility in working times and project mindsets to avoid conflicts.  
- A balance of technical and creative strengths to meet project needs.
