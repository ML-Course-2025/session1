# Activity 2: Lab Instructions: Exploring Python with Google Colab and Bing Copilot

#### **1. Getting Started**  
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and sign in with your Google account.  
2. Create a new Colab notebook by clicking on **File â†’ New Notebook**.  
3. Name your notebook appropriately, e.g., "Python Lab - Group [Your Group Name]".  

#### **2. Warm-Up Exercise**  
1. In your Colab notebook, open a new code cell and enter a question or description of the task you want to accomplish. For example:  
   - "How do I calculate the sum of numbers in Python?"  
   - "Write a Python function to check if a number is even."  
2. Use [**Bing Copilot**](https://copilot.microsoft.com) (accessible from your browser) to assist in writing the required code. Copy the suggested code into your notebook and execute it.  

#### **3. Exploring Kaggle Python Tutorials with Copilot**  
1. Access the Kaggle Python tutorials [here](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python).  
2. Choose one of the beginner-friendly topics (e.g., Functions, Loops, Lists).  
3. As a group, use [Bing Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) to guide you through understanding the concepts and writing the corresponding code. For example, you might ask:  
   - "Explain how loops work in Python with an example."  
   - "Write a program to iterate over a list and print each element."  
4. Copy the generated examples into your Colab notebook, run them, and modify the code to experiment further.  

#### **4. Group Task:**  
1. Based on what you've learned, design a small coding project with your group. Instead of writing code manually, ask **Bing Copilot** for suggestions or help. Examples of mini-projects:  
   - A program that calculates the average of a list of numbers.  
   - A game where users guess a randomly generated number.  
2. Collaboratively refine the code in your Colab notebook, test it, and ensure it works as intended.  

#### **5. Collaboration & Sharing**  
1. Use the "Share" button in Google Colab to grant edit or view access to other group members.  
2. Work in real-time with your group to finalize your notebook.  
3. Save your completed Colab notebook to your Google Drive.  


#### **Post-Lab Exploration (Optional)**  
1. Continue exploring the Kaggle Python tutorials after the lab session and consult Bing Copilot for any challenges you encounter.  
2. Try enhancing your group task or creating a new one using Copilot for coding assistance.
